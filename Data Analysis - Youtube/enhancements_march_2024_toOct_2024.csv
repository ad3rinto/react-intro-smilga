This in turn then leaves the Merlin created order as “Outstanding” and all the items within the order will remain as “Pending”. MWI Technical Support are then required to manually abandon the items from these orders so they are no longer “Pending” as the practice cannot update this from Merlin.

The same functionality/rules apply to the Merlin system.|
|*I want to be able to do/have?*|Clinical staff need to be able to search for a client's phone number using widley used format. It is a common occurence that phone numbers are presented with a space in for readability so tend to be entered in this manner.|
|*What is the current impact of not having this available?*|Currently, a search for a phone number will need to match _exactly_ the way it is stored in the PMS to receive a result. This means that clinical staff believe the system (either Digital Practice and/or the Merlin API) is broken and support tickets are raised.|
|*How would you like this to work? (please provide a step by step workflow):*|This is covered in the problem description above, the clinic should be able to enter a phone number in a transparent manner and receive results.|
|*What would be the benefit of having this feature?*|Optimising workflows for clinics and enabling more timely client and patient care.

Give me a call when free.  Thanks for helping fine tune this.   All the feedback is intended to make this work well for us both. 

To surmise some points to cover.

Dangerous drugs - The Biggest challenge .   
1.	A hard copy order was lost.  
2.	Up to 8d for delivery,  lways take alot longer than Covetrus.   
3.	Seemed that you were too busy to fulfill these at times?  We found out tht MWI had a pile of these to process.
4.	We have upped our stock levels to counter this but reception are finding this very hard.   At times clients have not got their meds which makes us look bad.
5.	We are nearly at the point of moving d/d's back to Covetrus as it is really hard to manage.

Back orders - Second biggest challenge- 
1.	We need an Abandon BUtton on Merlin for individual items.  
2.	The dunlops ordering is easier to use through merlin, could we bin ASN and do it that way?  Reception perceive no benefit of ASN.
3.	Training has been arranged through Kate to ensure this is not user ability at our end
4.	Back order dates.    MWI says ""possibly maybe mid November if the wind is blowing a SouthWesterly"".    Covetrus sends the below table, you should copy this?  
5.	Centaur tells us items are out of stock.   then we order them from someone else, then Centaur sends them the next day, they were actually in the other warehouse (Your stock control isn't too tight)
6.	We simply would like more items to say they are in stock and arrive the following day. 
product	description	quantity	Our Ref	Customer Ref	expected	chilled
PFSTR44	STRONGHOLD PLUS MED CAT 0.5ML 3 PIPETTE	6	15522124	23687280	2021-11-30	 

Availability of Stock
1.	You have significantly less available stock than Covetrus.   We are now buying isolated items from Covetrus because you do not have lines in stock. Up your stockholding?
2.	I  think many less planned stock lines than Covetrus?

Condition of Stock
1.	Reception tell me that this is all good now.   Thankyou",,Yaraslava Tkachova,,62e0eb6c3780798663d07fcf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12/12/2022 11:53

The prices are updating correctly for codes unless the code is marked as ""D"" in the price file, which means discontinued. 

I believe this to be a Defect in Merlin but I wanted to confirm this through a DAS first. 

Follow the steps below to replicate: 

1. Open Code Entry and ensure the following code exists: CANIGEN DHP 50 DOSE, Supplier Code: 30246043. 

2. Add this code using the Supplier Code search to import pricing information. 

3. The Cost Price should be showing as £522.60 (depending on when the last price update was done) 

4. Then perform a Wholesale Price Update in Merlin and commit the change. 

5. Go back to Code Entry and check the price of the product. The cost price of the item is still £522.60. 

6. If you check the latest Centaur Price File, you will see that the latest price of this item is £548.73 and that this item has a ""D"" listed at the front of the text of the code. This means it is discontinued. 

7. Wholesale Price Update has not updated the price of this discontinued item and others. 

The customer advises that although they cannot/will not order this item through Merlin, they still need the Wholesale Price Update to update the COST PRICE of the item otherwise they will not be charging enough money.

Items for an individual pet are not kept together by the system and whilst this can managed operationally for now, once we move into hundreds or thousands each day it becomes impossible to manage and therefore the risk grows considerably.",,11/03/2022 11:00

Stock Level Management & Ordering,CE-333,Idea,Closed,Major,Jordan Cottee,Jordan Cottee,04/01/2022 09:04,06/12/2022 09:25,"We ran Robovet for over 6 years, using auto-ordering with barely ever an issue with stock. I'll admit this has made us complacent in some ways but we relied on the system becuase we could, and it worked. Our stock management has been abysmal since the change to Merlin. Here are some of the issues we're finding. 

· Too many screens – why so many tabs? To track stock issues (a regular problems) you have to flick from stock levels to stock usage, and have to search the product in both screens

· Not able to look at stock movement across both sites at once.

· Batch levels not related to overall stock levels. Have to be adjusted separately - has led to all kinds of issues with vaccine levels. This was supposed to have been fixed but is still not correct e.g. we currently have total stock level of Nobivac DHP showing as 86, but batch holdings show 93.

· If logged into e.g. Formby, but looking at Crosby stock levels, if I then right click to adjust batches it only lets me adjust the batches for the logged in site, not the site I'm actually looking at. And it’s a pain to log out and log back in at the other site\!

Hi all, 

Please see below: 








Description of the Request:






Create a report that will show the stable addresses for clients who have equine patients
- This will need to include:
     client's address & postcode
     number of horses/ponies registered at the practice
     and the animals age
    (As well as the stable/ yard address)
What is the current impact of not having this available? The marketing team are currently unable to determine the location of our clients horses in relation to the practice and also other competitors. Unlike small animal clients, equines are unlikely to reside at a clients residential property meaning we are unable to segment and target clients based on their geographic location. 



How would you like this to work? (please provide a step by step workflow): Ideally, the practice should be able to pull a report adding filters to allow us to identify the above, however, I understand this can already be done? Apolgies I have no access to the PMS. However, I understand there is currently no area for the register yard to be added to the client/animals profile. This would ideally would just need to be an additional field within the PMS to add in the yards postcode. When pulling a report this would be added in as an additional field alongside the other client and animals data. 



What would be the benefit of having this feature?
 By identifying yards/stables where clients are present will allow for the correct marketing strategy to be implemented e.g if we have a yard where 90% of the equine registered clients are over the age of 10 a campaign aimed at a senior audience can be launched leading to more leads and ROI than targeting a yard that has a younger audience. Similarly, we will be able to identify trends such as lapsing clients at yard level which again provides the opportunity for a more targeted campaign, amongst others. It will also provide a central access point for the equine practices to be able to pull this data, currently, I assume this data is being held off the PMS which potentially poses a security risk?

if we could have a payment screen that simplified insurance payments that come in.  For example, we may have two or three insurance claims running for a client, when the payments come in from the insurance company it would be good if we could allocate them (like now) by seeing the insurance number and it would be even better if there was some sort of supporting screen that showed the deductions that had been made (i.e. a claim was submitted and outstanding on the account for £200, the insurance company paid £150 with a £50 excess deducted so we have a screen that shows the claim was £50 short of being paid off).  We can spend many hours unpicking the accounts screen for clients to establish what is outstanding for them to pay and what is still on insurance etc.",,Barend Seegers,Micheal Aderinto,5eed3549b364ce0abe776564,625a831556e5a8006ddb7b2f,,,,Additional functionality,,,Damory ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"

This is a very big impact for us.  We process approx 150-200 insurance claims per month.  Of which 90% of these are direct claims with insurance companies (meaning the balance of the treatment remains on Merlin awaiting payment from the insurance company).  When a payment comes in from the insurance, it is impossible to see what the payment should be allocated to, as the insurance number is not visible on the payment screen (problem 1).  This means it takes a long time to determine payment allocation (especially when there are multiple pets and claims) and often results in errors on allocation.  The next issue comes to advising clients on what is owed against that insurance claim as all of the payment and claims details are in with all the other account data, so you cant just click on a claim and see what was paid and what is as a result owed by the client.  This results in many man hours working backwards through accounts to unpick insurance payments, non-insured items to be paid etc.  In some cases where clients have multiple pets with multiple insurance conditions we have had to resort to a manual spreadsheet to cater for the lack of clarity on Merlin and now due to the time to manual method is taking we are having to stop some direct claims and insist on clients paying in advance (not good customer service).",,23/04/2021 14:18
Bank Transfers,CE-215,Idea,Idea Pipeline,Major,Barend Seegers,Barend Seegers,23/04/2021 14:13,07/12/2022 13:26,"	
We receive so many bank transfers now that we have someone spending many hours each day reading bank statements and paying off amounts on Merlin.

Good Morning

I trust that you are well and looking forward to the restrictions being lifted 😊

Please see correspondence below between Iris Kestemont (Peacock Vets) myself and our X-Ray support. As you will see we require some further detail from the Merlin software to be able to send the images from X-Ray machine via DICOM to it. 

Can you help me or put me in contact with someone who can?

Hi Dave,

Thank you for information. But I need more details.
This is general information from computer, but we need information about Merlin.

What “Merlin” is? Is it PACS and support Dicom? Does it have it database to store X-ray images? 

If it works with Dicom interface, so we need:

AE Title, Port number, IP address of “Merlin”.

Also Merlin support have to enter (usually) AE Title, Port number, IP address of VXvue program to here software (to exchange details to get connection between programs). 

Kind regards
Vidas

I'm just thinking this would be useful for new pups.
